title: "There May Never Be A Reliable Way to Predict All Conversations"

Tonight, I met with a former colleague to talk about technology. We'd worked for the same company but never met during my time there, as we worked in different offices. He happened to be in town and wanted to pick my brain about decentralized blockchain systems and use cases, as well as other technologies.

Our conversation ranged from the history of Bitcoin and the design problems it solved to the unrelated reasons energy is converted from direct current to alternating current for transmission over long distances. At some point, our conversation turned to the role of software in wrangling data from disparate systems into a location and form that can be analyzed in order to unlock new business insights. Thankfully, I had just this morning watched [a short video clip](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6490623370101616640/) posted by Lex Fridman of MIT demonstrating how software trained with MNIST data is used to perform image classification of numbers in a video of numbers that change in real-time. (This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_deep_learning_basics/deep_learning_basics.ipynb) explains in great detail how the neural network, which in this case is a convolutional neural network, is trained to make predictions about which number it is viewing.)

After I showed my old teammate the video, I reflected on how context-sensitive and relevant that choice of video was to the business problem he'd just described, and how serendipitous it was that the video was both top-of-mind for me in that moment and, due to the recency of seeing it, at hand. You seldom know, in advance, how exactly a conversation will transpire, or when exactly something you've previously learned or consumed will become useful in a conversation.

Even if it ever becomes technically possible to do so, perhaps humans and machines will never want to be able to predict with absolute certainty how all conversations will go, if for no other reason than that if you could predict every conversation, then I suppose there would be little to learn by conversing.
