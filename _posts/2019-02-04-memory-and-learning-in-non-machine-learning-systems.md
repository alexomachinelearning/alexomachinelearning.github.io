I found a note I wrote last summer:

> The killer feature all humans have is the ability to learn. The brain is a general-purpose platform for learning. Our central nervous system allows us to interact, to consume and translate our experiences into memories. This is essentially why we have everything from beloved [music] albums and Picasso paintings to virtual machines powered by a cryptocurrency to a robot on Mars digging up carbon and methane."

I wonder if, without the ability to form and retrieve memories, we would be able to learn, and what that connection between the process of observation and memory formation on the one hand, and the process of memory retrieval and the learning process on the other, has to teach us about how to program learning systems. It's not just our own memory formation and the "killer app" such memory formation makes possible in individuals that matters. It's also that we are able to create shared learning experiences with one or more other persons *and* we're able to reference those shared memories and shared learnings to collaborate and coordinate in groups and teams. Our ability to remember things also allows us to remind others of things they've nearly forgotten, reinforcing learning in not just ourselves but in peers also. As we learn and work in groups to build often complex things, from music to art to computing systems to robots, memory and learning form foundations to outcomes that are impossible to attain alone: through that work with others, we form a temporary learning "system". (As another note, I wonder if what neurotransmitters do for internal regulation of learning processes for individuals, emotions do for external regulation of learning processes between and among peers in social systems).

Software trained by machine learning isn't to my knowledge able to perform "passing on" or "reminding of" to other software to enhance learning, or of activating previous "shared learning model training sessions" as part of subsequent trainings, but I look forward to learning more about the concept and mechanics of (presumably supervised) _transfer learning_.
