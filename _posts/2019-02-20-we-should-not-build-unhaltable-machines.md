I started to read Trent McConaghy's "[Blockchains for Artificial Intelligence](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/blockchains-for-artificial-intelligence-ec63b0284984)". It's a good 23-minute read. Although it's over two years old, I just came across it on my Medium feed. I was pleased to see it, since [one of my early motivations](https://ahumanlearningmachinelearning.com/2019/01/01/my-open-source-machine-learning-journey-begins/) for learning about machine learning is to better understand what the possibilities for data science will be once blockchains become more prevalent as infrastructural IT backbones in society, and decentralized distributed database systems become accessible to other tools of data science.

Over the last few days, I've been thinking about artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of principles we ought to establish for building AI. Thus, this line in McConaghy's piece tonight caught my eye:

> Opportunity 6: AI DAOs — AI that can accumulate wealth, that you can’t turn off. This one’s a doozy. An AI DAO is AI that owns itself, that you can’t turn off.

I don't much like the concept of software that owns itself and can't be stopped, for reasons I'll be writing about once I finalize my thinking on _Principles for Building AI_. Some things are self-evident but must nonetheless be said.

We should not build unhaltable machines.
