I came across a good explanation of and conversation about a machine learning xkcd cartoon I've seen a few times, called [Machine Learning](https://www.xkcd.com/1838/). The setup goes like this:

> **Friend 1**: "_This_ is your machine learning system?"
>
> **Friend 2**: "Yup! You pour the data into this big pile of linear algebra, then collect the answers on the other side."
>
> **Friend 1**: "What if the answers are wrong?"
>
> **Friend 2**: "Just stir the pile until they start looking right."

It's definitely a clever cartoon, typical for xkcd.

The _Friend 2_, presumably a machine learning researcher performing supervised learning, stands on top of "a pile of data". If you look closely at the pile, you'll notice not only several Greek math symbols and a few numbers strewn about the data pile, but also you'll spot a few matrices and a vector. These might represent things like the weights for each neuron and the activations of a layer (see [this 3Blue1Brown video on neural networks](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?t=805)). It's also worth pointing out that the data funnel *is* the neural network into which piles of training data are poured, at least with machine learning in real life, so it would be more accurate to position the "answers" box immediately underneath the stem, thought that would make the cartoon or its punchline a lot less interesting. There's a lot going on in this seemingly simple xkcd!

For more on this cartoon, including a cool discussion about _support vector machines_, see [_explain xkcd_, "1838: Machine Learning"](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1838:_Machine_Learning).
