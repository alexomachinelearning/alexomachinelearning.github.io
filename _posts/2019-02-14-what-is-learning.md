To understand learning or venture a guess at the purpose of learning, you first have to understand that the purpose of a nerve net or a nervous system is to "sense and respond" to internal and/or external information. For example, nerve nets—which are ["the simplest form of a nervous system found in multicellular organisms"][1], ["consist of interconnected neurons"][1], and ["evolved first"][2] in the evolutionary history of nervous systems—allow organisms such as jellyfish to move about in the ocean: not aimlessly, and perhaps not purposely, but in response to environmental stimuli.

But why would an organism have a need to respond? Because it needs to move (and not simply *be* moved). An organism cannot move if it cannot sense, and it cannot sense if it doesn't have the instrument to first sense and then respond. That's what neurons are for.

Notice that the _only_ animal kingdom member that doesn't move is the sponge, and it is the only animal kingdom member that doesn't have a [nerve net][1] or a [nervous system][3]. (Despite being in the Animal kingdom, sponges belong to a [sister group][4] of the phylogenetic sibling from which animals descend). Some articles point out that some sponges move by a few millimeters per day, but this might be purely as a byproduct of the way their [epithelial cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinacoderm) work, not locomotion proper. And the only other non-animal organisms that move (i.e., have _motility_, or a means of locomotion) are those that use the flagellum, which, curiously enough, has ["the primary function...of locomotion, but...also often functions as a sensory organelle, being sensitive to chemicals and temperatures outside the cell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum#Evolution). So, for our purposes, all animals move by sensing and responding, and all non-animals that move have a (crude) means to both sense and respond.

So nervous systems (and biological neurons) may have been an adaptation to forces requiring increasingly sophisticated movement. Said another way, the need for advanced movement might be the reason advanced nervous systems evolved. In the context of primates, this makes me consider if the need to _plan_ movements (e.g., in order to flee predators or hunt prey) is what gave rise to the prefrontal cortex, and if the need to coordinate movement across geographies and within social groups correlated with bursts of brain evolution in animals at certain times in our evolutionary past. I also wonder if verbal communication and language evolved as a consequence of the need to coordinate even more advanced movement at the group level, and what the importance of eyesight to movement has to say about the sheer amount of human neural activity that goes into sensing and responding to visual data. All of this is cause for further research.

If we consider that the need to move through complex physical environments may have created the evolutionary pressure for animals to develop the ability to learn, then the history and development (and future) of learning is really the history and biological development of willful (conscious) movement. Taken further, might consciousness be a feature that solves some definable problem, much as the heart solves a problem of circulation or language solves a problem of communication, having to do with sensing and responding to a complex physical space, of moving through it?

And might motion be incorporated into machine learning models in order to more rapidly train them?
