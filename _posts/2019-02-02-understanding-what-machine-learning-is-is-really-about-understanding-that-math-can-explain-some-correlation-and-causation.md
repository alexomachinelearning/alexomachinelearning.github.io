On Wikipedia, it says that machine learning is...

> ...the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on models and inference instead.

One of the things that clicked for me late last month after reading excerpts from several books, reading the Lecture 1 slides from MIT's Deep Learning class, and consuming other resources is that the process of machine learning is all about this: computer software discovering, through trial and error, the math (and stats) that can accurately describe relationships in data, and then later using the mathematical explanation of those relationships to describe new data the software encounters, all in order to make accurate predictions about that data. Doing this well and doing it "in scope" for the predictions at hand is, of course, the secret sauce of machine learning engineers.

Once you get your head wrapped around that concept (that machine learning is about training software to make predictions by helping it or letting it figure out the right math to describe why certain inputs lead to certain outputs, and then feeding it new inputs later on which to compute—predict—new outputs), everything else in your learning begins to fall into place. The tools, techniques, and terminology of machine learning all then become easier to place on their correct shelves.

If you can teach software to learn how to detect important correlations, to correctly identify what causes certain things to happen, and then to use mathematics to predict things that are valid and predictable, then you step in the direction of true AI, however far away such a thing may be.
