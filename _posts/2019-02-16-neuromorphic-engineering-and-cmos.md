While reading about _spiking neural networks_, I came across a research paper mentioning CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology, which is sometimes used in neuromorphic engineering. Neuromorphic computing is an approach to computational hardware that uses integrated circuits based on analog (continuous, as opposed to binary) signals, with the purpose to ["mimic neuro-biological architectures present in the nervous system"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering). This engineering field is responsible for some of the implementations of machine learning systems that are in production, e.g., autonomous vehicles.

One of the more interesting aspects of CMOS is that some researchers have relatively recently been able to create CMOS chips that essentially [mimic, or model](https://news.mit.edu/2011/brain-chip-1115) neurotransmitter-based activity between the axon of a biological neuron and the dendrite of the next.

If successful at scale, CMOS-based computing hardware (or something else capable of modeling the non-digital nature of nervous systems) would be a stepping stone to something key: the possibility of communicating analog-to-digital information from a real neuron to an artificial neural network for real-time training and other digital uses, or the digital-to-analog conversion of outputs from a neural network to data the brain can use and its neurons can act on.

Much like an image can be converted into and represented as digital data in order to populate a convolutional neural network for use in image recognition tasks, so, too, will we need a way to convert real neurotransmitter activity into a computer-understandable, digital equivalent for use in artificial neural networks and other computational tasks.

Perhaps the field of neuromorphic engineering will supply the needed tech.
