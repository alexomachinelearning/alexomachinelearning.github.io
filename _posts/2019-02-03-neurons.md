Brains are the best general computers known to exist in the universe. The way an animal or human brain learns and computes is pretty incredible. This learning and computation is possible due to many things and a great many brain areas, but one microscopic reason learning and biological computation are possible is that animals and humans have neurons.

"Neurons in the brain have connections, called synapses, to tens of thousands of other neurons, and they all operate in parallel." So tells us Alpaydin (_Machine Learning_, pp. 20). In addition to this interconnectedness and "parallelizability", the structure, function, and number of neurons, and the brilliant designs and operations of thought they make possible, accounts for the magic of neuronal computation (of which thinking is probably a type).

Here are a few resources I'd like to dig into when I have some time:

- The application of machine learning & computer vision to understanding how humans sense: [2018's lecture for "MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2GfE8pLyxc)
- The young field of [computational neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience), particularly the [behaviors of networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience#Behaviors_of_networks) and always-interesting bioelectrochemical pathway light takes to get to our occipital lobes
- The DeepMind project's research article ["Towards an integration of Deep Learning and Neuroscience"](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/towards-integration-deep-learning-and-neuroscience/)
- [Machine Learning in Neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/9012/machine-learning-in-neuroscience#overview), a new research topic in _Frontiers_ that has six manuscripts under peer review
