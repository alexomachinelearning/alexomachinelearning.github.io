Over the last few days, I've found myself bothered by a simple thought: what are the hidden consequences of using machine learning software to determine which resumes a company should consider? A few months ago, I submitted a job application late at night, including my resume, and by very early the following morning, I received a rejection message. I assumed the message was automated. My interpretation was that no human had ever looked at my resume, and I bookmarked the thought.

Last week, I went through the onboarding process for my new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account. One of the products that come with GCP is [Cloud Talent Solution](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/talent-solution/), which is a set of APIs for powerful job search and candidate matching tools for enterprises. I haven't yet learned the details of how it works, but it did make me think again about my experience from a few months ago.

Consider this quote from the opening chapter of Pedro Domingos's [_The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465065708) (p. xiv):

> Perhaps when you applied for your job, a learning algorithm picked your resume from the virtual pile and told your prospective employer: here's a strong candidate; take a look."

Without knowing how commonplace this practice yet is, the question I have about it is this is: if companies begin to rely on machine learning-based tools to screen applicants, then they'll be incentivized to continue using the tool for which they've paid, and their talent recruitment professionals who work for them will become accustomed to a workflow that utilizes screening tools such as the one described in the quote. But since the resume continues to be a first step to getting many job interviews, then those with the training or knowledge of how to craft a resume that competes well in machine learning software will gain an important advantage in the job application process. On average, those candidates may be invited more often to phone screens, and, by virtue of having larger volumes of human-to-human conversation with prospective employers, they'll advance more quickly to interviews and to job offers, in shorter time frames. Presumably, many others who are otherwise well-qualified or could perform the work but who don't have a resume document optimized for positive classification could well end up mystified by rejections they can't explain and, ironically, don't get the opportunity to learn from.

To be sure, there's a great deal of difference between possibility and implementation. There's a lot to know about how these systems work and how they're deployed, if they even are. Relationships and good word-of-mouth have always been the largest drivers of consideration for jobs, and this is unlikely to change even with advanced technologies in the toolsets of companies. But the core of that premise is that relationships matter and that, to some extent, we are in control of whether or not we develop those relationships.

If, on the other hand, relationships start to matter less during the job application process—if the relative importance of scores and assessments and statistical analyses on information on resumes increases—then I do wonder how that shift might both positively impact the job application process at scale _and_ penalize those without either relationships or knowledge of how to present their work experience and professional skills in the best possible, machine learning-friendly, light.
