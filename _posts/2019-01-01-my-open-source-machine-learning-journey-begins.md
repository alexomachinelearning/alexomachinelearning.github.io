Earlier today on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6485926687635832832), I wrote the following:

> 2018 was a year of learning...2019 will be a year of dual-wielding, of learning and applying: learning more about distributed systems and decentralized blockchains, learning about machine learning, experimenting with applications, applying my heart to clearer goals, learning to apply ever-stronger curiosity to my mission, and allowing myself to fully explore my hunches.

A little over one year ago, I began to learn about blockchains, distributed ledgers, and cryptography. Once you learn the basics of what makes these work together, it's easy to become excited about the future of information. In a world that will increasingly rely on ways to store, access, distribute, and analyze data from a combination of centralized, distributed, and decentralized stores, the essential follow-up question becomes, "How will humans use data to build machines that help advance the aims of our societies?"

This thinking prompted me two weeks ago to consider what else I should be learning in the year(s) ahead, which includes machine learning itself. Believing as I do that technology can and should be used for good, and that we ought to use our best ideas in service of our best ideals, I can't help but try to understand such an important piece of modern technology's surface area, namely the intersection of machine learning, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and our chosen tomorrow.

As I wrote in the rest of today's LinkedIn post:

>"**In a time of such great problems, we can't afford not to throw ourselves, with great delight and strong conviction, at reducing the number of mysteries that barr human progress.**"

In this blog, my aim is to "open-source my learning journey in machine learning", so that my current peers and future generations can see what it's like a for a human to learn about a technology that will someday power many foundations of the human experience. As I've recently started to read about machine learning, to ask questions, and to ponder the unknown, this space is to serve as part diary, part blog, and part playground to build and share my neural networks in the future. The wonderful thing about the human learning process is that it is one part neuroscience and one part magic, the output of the work of our biological neurons tussling and wrestling with connections, ideas, dead ends, mistakes, breakthroughs, awe, wonder, curiosity, memories, problems, and the dual selective pressures of life and imagination. Someday, in the very far-off future, long after I'm gone, humanity may create learning machines capable of appreciating all the joys contained in that previous sentence. Until then, I and we have a lot to learn about the human mind, about computers, about data, and how that data can be used to train computers to make better predictions on our behalf.

What will I find in this machine learning journey of the mind?
