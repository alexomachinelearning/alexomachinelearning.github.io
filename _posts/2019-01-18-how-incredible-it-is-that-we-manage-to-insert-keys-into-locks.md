Upon returning to my apartment from a coffee run this morning, I marveled at something small: my key entered the door lock perfectly on my first attempt. This is not the sort of thing we often think about, but when things like this happen, your brain has had to perform admirably in a number of areas:

* concentration, required to search for the key and insert it into the lock
* cortical decision-making, required to choose to open the door and carry out your decision
* visual processing
* spatial analysis and proprioception, to approximate the location of your body and hand in relation to the door and the lock
* hand-eye coordination & physical movement, needed to insert the key into the lock
* assimilation of sensory information, likely by the thalamus and other brain regions, and including sight, sound, and touch, to register feedback from the lock such that you can a) confirm that the key has been inserted successfully before turning it and b) determine the appropriate force, speed, pressure, etc. to apply to this interaction between you, the lock, and the door
* some analysis of time, to assess how long it's taken, relative to how long it should take, for you to perform this task (e.g., less than 2,000 milliseconds)
* memory retrieval and formation, to compare the experience against previous experiences and compare future experiences against this one

When we're babies, it is very hard to hold a spoon, but eventually this becomes easy, and it becomes possible to feed ourselves. Many much more technically demanding manual tasks of course follow.

Imagine how difficult it is for a machine to hold a spoon, much less try to land perfect key lock entry. Imagine how much a computer would have to do and calculate in order to move a robotic hand into a keyhole perfectly and with just the right combination of predictions and real-time decisional adjustments. And to do that without the benefit of the dazzling biological neural networks in our brains, hand-crafted by direct experience. It certainly gives me an appreciation for how hard it must be build artificial neural networks that can be applied to make predictions and implemented in software for dynamic movement tasks in the real world.

On this note, it's worth noting that the average rate of new neural connections per second in the young human brain is 1,000,000+ for every second of every minute of every hour of every day for the first few years of life (see Harvard Center on the Developing Child's ["Brain Architecture"](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/brain-architecture/) and ["Five Numbers to Remember About Early Childhood Development"](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/five-numbers-to-remember-about-early-childhood-development/)). This astounding rate of connection-making would lead to an estimated total of 94,672,800,000,000 (94.6728 trillion) neural connections in the brain by the time a toddler is three years old.

I'm not suggesting that for machines to be able to do manual tasks, they need the same number, types, or composition of neural connections humans develop and have. Perhaps we'll find a shortcut for learning machines. [Alpaydin](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ethem-alpaydin) (2016) proves insightful on the concept of shortcuts (pp. 21-22):

> The classic example is the difference between natural and artificial flying machines. A sparrow flaps its wings; an airplane does not flap its wings but uses jet engines. The sparrow and the airplane are two hardware implementations built for different purposes, satisfying different constraints. But they both implement the same theory, which is aerodynamics. [...] Just as the initial attempts to build flying machines looked a lot like birds until we discovered the theory of aerodynamics, it is also expected that the first attempts to build structures possessing the brain's abilities will look like the brain with networks of large numbers of processing units. [...] In time, when we discover the computational theory of intelligence, we may discover that neurons and synapses are implementation details, just as we have realized that feathers are for flying.

Whether or not we'll find shortcuts for training learning models for use in software for fine motor control, it *is* remarkable that in our first few years, as those trillions of new neural connections are being made in our toddler brains, we begin our journeys towards the concentration, cortical decision-making, visual processing, spatial analysis, proprioception, hand-eye coordination, movement, sensory assimilation, temporal analysis (not related to speech), and memory formation and retrieval that go on to become relevant, many years later, as we insert keys perfectly into locks.

Pretty amazing stuff.

I don't yet know enough about the makings of machine learning models or robotics to properly consider the would-be digital equivalents of everything that's happening in analog form in our brains as we insert a key into a lock, but it must be a lot.
