In the first few pages of a chapter on human learning in Pedro Domingos's book "[The Master Algorithm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465065708)", the author suggests that if we better understood early neural development in infants, we'd likely also better understand how learning works. We might then apply that understanding to applications of machine learning. Then he adds:

> An infant's mind isn't just the unfolding of a predefined genetic program or a biological device for recording correlations in sense data; rather, the infant's mind actively synthesizes his or her reality, and this reality changes quite radically over time. (Domingos, p. 204)

This is good food for thought about what constitutes consciousness, when it first emerges in children, and what, in addition to genetic changes and lived experience in those first three years of life, leads to self-awareness. In order to be conscious, there must be some way to assess what's real demarcate it from what isn't real. In order to make that assessment, I imagine there must be a way to actually learn what is and isn't real, and also some means of incorporating sensory ("sense") data into the young mind's developing assessment of "real" is.

Given how many hours a day infants sleep, this makes me wonder about the role sleep may play in the process of individuation we go through when we're very young, and if it's possible to develop biological or artificial general intelligence without significant sleep in the most formative years of intelligence-forming. What role might "time away from sensory data" (i.e., time sleeping) play in helping us assess the fitness and realness of sensory information, of validating the authenticity of reality, and of [authenticating the persons in our lives](https://ahumanlearningmachinelearning.com/2019/02/05/inchoate-questions-about-authentication-and-human-visual-recognition/) (which, to note, is a very small number when we're so little). Those questions probably don't diminish in importance as we age, though there are some curious questions we can ask regarding sleep and learning in early, middle, and late adulthood too.

Neural development, sleep, and learning are, unsurprisingly, tethered, though perhaps to a surprisingly tight degree.
