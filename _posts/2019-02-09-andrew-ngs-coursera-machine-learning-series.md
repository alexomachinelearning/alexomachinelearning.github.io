A commenter on LinkedIn today recommended Andrew Ng's Coursera [_Deep Learning Specialization_](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) to anyone wishing to learn how to build their own neural networks. Despite the title, a description that reads "Deep Learning Specialization. Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI", and a label of intermediate difficulty, it sounds as though Ng makes it easy to learn how to build a NN from scratch. This is now on my list of must-take coursework for this summer, by which time I should be ready to try building some basic neural nets. Note that the series demands 11 hours of work per week (suggested) for three months, for a total of over 120 hours of work across the following five courses:

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)
3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)
5. [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)

Since the fifth course is for building learning models for NLP and audio, this series can nicely complement the work of [building a custom Alexa skill](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/steps-to-build-a-custom-skill.html). Even if you won't be able to or need to build your own neural network to build an Alexa skill, understanding how such networks work might make the build process more rewarding.
