I started learning Python today. After having a few discussions with machine learning developers and AI researchers, the consensus was that Python is a great first programming language to learn. Below are various reasons:

* There are many excellent tools and libraries for Python, and it's a well-supported language with a vibrant, global developer community around it
* Several of the excellent resources that I've mentioned already on this blog are Python-based. See ["Resources for the Newcomer to Machine Learning"](https://ahumanlearningmachinelearning.com/2019/01/02/resources-for-the-newcomer-to-machine-learning/) and ["Advice on Selecting Programming Languages for Working with Neural Networks"](https://ahumanlearningmachinelearning.com/2019/01/06/advice-on-selecting-programming-languages-for-working-with-neural-networks/)
* Some of the best general learning content I've encountered for learning about neural networks and how they're trained (for example, 3Blue1Brown's video [on multilayer perceptrons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) and the accompanying [video on gradient descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w)) feature Python walkthroughs with training data + sample code. One example is [Michael Nielsen's walkthrough](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html#implementing_our_network_to_classify_digits), which uses MNIST data and supervised learning to teach a multilayer perceptron how to classify handwritten numbers in images
* Finally, I've come across an easy-to-follow training for Python 2: Zed Shaw's [_Learn Python the Hard Way_](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/), which already has taught me a few basics. I discovered this resource after taking Zed's [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html), also helpful for a newcomer to coding

You can follow my open-sourced Python learning journey in the months and years ahead on GitHub at [ahumanlearningmachinelearning](https://github.com/alexomachinelearning/ahumanlearningmachinelearning), where in addition to sharing what I'm learning about programming as I learn it, I'll eventually build and share my own neural networks as well.
