In ["New Terms and Concepts for Further Study I"](https://ahumanlearningmachinelearning.com/2019/01/10/new-terms-and-concepts-for-further-study-i/), I listed 28 words and concepts that were foreign to me at the time at the time of writing, that I might study some of them further. Since, 40-50% of those terms have become a bit more familiar. The ["Deep Learning Basics"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c0g3sc1shi63x3q/deep_learning_basics.pdf?dl=0) lecture slides by Lex Fridman MIT's Deep Learning course did a good job of surfacing many more terms and concepts that make up the machine learning lexicon.

Below I list new ones that I need to spend some time learning, contextualizing, and bucketizing.

## Terms and Concepts

I still haven't made time for topographic maps.
