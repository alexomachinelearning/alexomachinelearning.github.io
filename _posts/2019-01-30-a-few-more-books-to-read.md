An industry peer today put me onto the popular blog post, ["Learning AI if You Suck at Math"](https://hackernoon.com/learning-ai-if-you-suck-at-math-8bdfb4b79037) by Daniel Jeffries. It's a seven-part series that I've bookmarked. Jeffries is a fun writer, and in the introduction to his series, he includes several books worth adding to a list of math and AI material to bootstrap one's learning. Those include:

* [Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618) — Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengiom, Aaron Courville
* [Make Your Own Neural Network](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network/dp/1530826608) - Tariq Rashid + [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork)
* [Mathematical Notation: A Guide for Engineers and Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Notation-Guide-Engineers-Scientists/dp/1466230525) — Edward R. Scheinerman
* [Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Short-Introduction-Timothy-Gowers/dp/0192853619) — Timothy Gowers
* [Mathematics for the Nonmathematician](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Nonmathematician-Morris-Kline/dp/0486248232) — Morris Kline
* [No Bullshit Guide to Math and Physics](https://www.amazon.com/No-bullshit-guide-math-physics/dp/0992001005) — Ivan Savov
