# About page

Thanks for visiting. I'm a human learning about machine learning. I like to open-source my learning journeys. This is part diary, part blog, and part playground to build and share my neural networks in the future. I can be found learning and playing on LinkedIn and other spaces. I will add those spaces here over time.
