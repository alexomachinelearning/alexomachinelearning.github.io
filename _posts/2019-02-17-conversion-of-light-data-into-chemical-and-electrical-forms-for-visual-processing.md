This one's a short one. I'd like to compare how visible light is converted for visual processing in the brain with how images and real-time visuals are converted into machine-legible data for processing in convolutional neural networks, as well as how autonomous vehicles move in response to incoming visual data. I'll return to the latter process, but for now here's a summary of the former.

In human eyesight, the process more or less goes like this:

1. Light passes through the cornea and onto the lens ~>
2. The lens focuses the light onto the retina ~>
3. As light hits retinal cells, including rods and cones, the light data occasions biochemical reactions that reach ganglion cells, also in the retina~>
4. These chemical signals elicit a response in the ganglion cells, producing electrical action potentials ~>
6. These now-electrical signals pass from the ganglion cells, through the optic nerve, to the thalamus ~>
7. The thalamus routes the electrical data to the visual cortex for visual processing ~>
8. (The cortex subsequently routes certain information to areas of our brain responsible for coordinating or actioning movement, via electrical signal sent through motor neurons)
9. (We move)

To be continued...
